the number of group member:1 person

summary:
The whole project has 9 .c file and 10 .h file.
I did a little bit changing of the giving header file, but data structure didn't change at all.

For scanner: 
I didn't us the TokenList structure, but directly use TokenNode structure for the main function. 

For parser:
I used the second version of grammar,and totally parse the every syntax in the giving file.

For analyser:
I built the symbol table and did symbol check at the same time.
and did the type check after.  

For error and control:
I didn't finish the full error handling, so it can't report many error for only compile one time. 
And I didn't set processCmd available. 


It can successfully compile the seven file that didn't have the error in the giving .cm file.
